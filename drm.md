## Supported DRM Schemes

The following DRM schemes are supported in Android devices:

### Widevine Modular  

* Supported in Android 4.3 and up
* Online and offline playback

### Widevine Classic  

* Supported in Android 3.0 to 6.0, **exclusive**
    * Starting with Android 6, Google-certified Android devices are not required to support Widevine Classic
* Online and offline playback

## Requirements

An application that uses DRM should call the following API as early as possible (if applicable, in the splash screen):

```java
MediaSupport.initializeDrm(Context, DrmInitCallback)
```

Calling this function makes sure that the DRM subsystem (in particular, Widevine) is ready before playback starts. In some cases, devices 
have to be provisioned to use Widevine, a process that involves connecting to a Google service over the network.

## Known Limitations  

* Widevine Classic files (.wvm) cannot be served over https (SSL)
* Emulators
	* *Widevine Classic* does not work on the emulator
	* *Widevine Modular* only works on emulator with API level 23 and up
